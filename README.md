## üìñ Introduction

LLM Travel Alert is an open sourse project that leverages advanced language models to provide real-time travel advisories and alerts. Building upon the MultiverseNote backend, this project integrates enhanced tool support and utilizes Ollama as the service backend to deliver timely and accurate information to travelers worldwide.

By transforming AI chatbot interactions into structured, actionable alerts, LLM Travel Alert aims to enhance the safety and convenience of global travelers. The platform introduces a branch management system where users can discuss general travel topics on the main branch and initiate new branches for specific destinations or issues, allowing for systematic and continuous information development.
