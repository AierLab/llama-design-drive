# Whole Vision

> Sometimes, tasks are not suitable for collaboration‚Äîcoding falls under such a category.

In the Agile development process, we need to select a dedicated time slot to build the MVP together with full contribution, and then gradually update it in spare time based on feedback from the users.

With this approach, we divide our tasks into 3 stages: **Design**, **Development**, and **Polish**.

---

## 1. üé® Design

In this step, we summarize all design ideas, filter out the requirements for the MVP, and ensure that the MVP is complete and scalable.

### Key Points:
- **Team Division**: Two main groups
    - **NLP Design Team**: Jiaxin and the NLP team (Jiacheng, Chenxi).
    - **Domain Specialist Team**: Haobo and Rushil, working with Shiqi and Dr. Yan.
- **Goal**: Design the way we use LLMs (including prompt engineering) and determine tools to evaluate the input data.

### Requirements:
1. Keep terms in the design document at an abstract level‚Äîavoid specifying frameworks or tools directly.
2. Provide useful information such as recommended packages or frameworks to choose from in the development phase.
3. Use graphs where necessary to demonstrate the system design and provide detailed explanations for each node or element in the diagram.

## 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Development

The engineering group will find a time slot (like Saturday and Sunday) and commit 20 hours per person. We will dive fully into the project through group or pair programming to complete the MVP and deploy it with the "Alpha" version tag.

### Action Plan:
- **Schedule**: A time will be set for everyone, not just the engineering team. This schedule will be announced later.
- **Goal**: Complete the MVP based on the design/requirements document and deploy it for user feedback.

## 3. üåü Polish

The Alpha version will be tested within the group. Issues will be raised continuously, and engineers will work on resolving them to gradually polish the application.

### Action Plan:
- Submit issues on GitHub.
- Those who can solve these issues will allocate time to address them and improve the application.

# üóì Plan for Each Stage

## Design:
- [ ] **NLP Team** (Jiaxin, NLP group): Focus on LLM usage, including prompt engineering.
- [ ] **Domain Team** (Haobo, Rushil, Domain experts): Focus on evaluating input data.
- [ ] **Requirement**: Ensure design stays abstract and includes suggestions for tools/frameworks for the next phase. Use graphs for clarity.
- [ ] **Optional**: Conduct preliminary user interviews to refine the MVP‚Äôs functionality and scope.

## Development:
- [ ] Announce a schedule for full participation.
- [ ] Develop and deploy the MVP for initial feedback.
- [ ] **Optional**: Organize a hackathon-style weekend to encourage innovation and problem-solving in real-time.

## Polish:
- [ ] Submit and track issues continuously on GitHub.
- [ ] Engineers to address issues gradually to refine and enhance the application.
- [ ] **Optional**: Schedule periodic review meetings to assess application performance and user satisfaction.
